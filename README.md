**Note that this only works in Node 0.10 now, using the new Streams.**

Drinks and vomits Stream contents. Promised to be really noisy.

As you could probably guess, this is totes influenced by the [Clojure core
library](http://clojuredocs.org/clojure_core/clojure.core/slurp). But more
general :D


## Example

```js
var noisyo = require('noisyo')
var spit   = noisyo.spit
var slurp  = noisyo.slurp

// Slurp takes a Stream and returns a Promise of its contents.
// Spit takes a Stream, and some contents, and returns a Promise of the
// eventual draining.
spit(process.stdout, slurp(process.stdin))

// So, why not just `.pipe()`?
// Well, these work with both Strings and Streams interchangeably.
var input = slurp(process.stdin)
input.then(function(data) {
  console.log(data)
  spit(fs.createWriteStream('foo.txt'), data)
})

// Obviously, you *will* want to use Streams directly if you're interested in
// piping between them, this is not a substitute for Streams, just a nice,
// high-level way of getting to its contents in one-shot quickly and
// asynchronously. But it will buffer the whole thing in memory, which might be
// *bad* in certain cases.
```
